# CollabProject

Project Description:

The project is about linking programmers together and providing a network of other programmers for a project. As a programmer you would start by logging in to the website. You will have two choices, either look for projects to work on or post your own project that you need help in. To be able to filter through the projects to make it easier for who wants to help, we will provide tags where users can filter through the kind of project they want to work with. Users have the option to search for projects or users to be able to connect with each other. The users will have a choice to upload their github project for others to see and test out the code for themselves. After checking the project out, the user will have a choice to apply for volunteering in the code, and after a time span the original poster will have a chance to pick the person they want to work with and share each otherâ€™s details within the website. When the collaboration happens, both the project poster and the volunteer can rate each other in the sense that it would help the community know who to pick and who to steer away from. This way the website will feature the projects of people with the highest ratings to incentivize people to work hard to be helped and find partners.





This is the Github Repository where we can store our project files and directly download the files and use them on eclipse.
